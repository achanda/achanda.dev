I am Abhishek (he/him). I have wore many hats in the past, I have been a published author, a researcher, a software engineer, an SRE, 
a tech lead, a people manager. My current role is a staff engineer at Cloudflare where I am a part of the Postgres team. 
We provide Postgres as a managed service for Cloudflare. On any average day, we support up to 20% of the whole Internetâ€™s traffic.

Other than work, I love to travel (been to 26 countries so far, lived in 3 countries) and hanging out with my family.
